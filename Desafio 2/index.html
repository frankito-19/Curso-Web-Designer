        <p class="p1">Recently, Bandai Namco lifted the curtain on the fourth title in the Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi series,
            titled Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 4, during the Dragon Ball FighterZ World Tour 2022/2023 finals event.
            An official release window has yet to be announced, however.

            Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is a series of fighting games developed by Spike based on the Dragon Ball
            manga series by Akira Toriyama. From 2005 to 2007, Namco Bandai Games published the series under the Bandai
            brand name in Japan and Europe and under the Atari name in North America and Australia. Atariâ€™s involvement
            was effectively ended when its PAL distribution network was absorbed into Bandai Namco Partners, and since
            2010, Bandai Namco has also handled publishing in North America for upcoming Dragon Ball Z games.</p>
